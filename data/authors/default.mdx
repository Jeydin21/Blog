Hello! I am a student learning computer science and web development in high school. My favorite research topic is component-based architecture in web applications, most commonly used by frontend Javascript frameworks like React and NextJS

I'm interested in frontend design, which I find to be very interesting to use with tools like React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS at my disposal. I hope to become a web development major or something web design related, because I believe that making cool websites that follow design trends is a form of modern art.
